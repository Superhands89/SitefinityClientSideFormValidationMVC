# SitefinityClientSideFormValidationMVC
Custom form validation for Sitefinity MVC forms using vanilla client side JavaScript.

## Includes...

* Validation of all fields and inputs at once, thus removing the need to rely on HTML5 validation of each field individually
* Pattern validation for email and number fields etc.
* Smooth scrolling to areas that fail validation on form submit
* Allows creative control over the way form validtaion is handled

To implement, simply run the code found in the "SF_ClientSideFormValidation.js" file on a page that contains a Sitefinity MVC form. You can even paste it in the Chrome DevTools console on such a page to see it in action.
