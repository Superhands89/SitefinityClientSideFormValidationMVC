# SitefinityClientSideFormValidationMVC
Custom form validation for Sitefinity MVC forms using vanilla client side JavaScript.

## Includes...

* Validation of all fields and inputs at once, thus removing the need to rely on HTML5 validation of each field individually
* Pattern validation for email and number fields etc.
* Smooth scrolling to areas that fail validation on form submit
* Allows creative control over the way form validtaion is handled

## Usage...

To implement, simply run the code found in the "SF_ClientSideFormValidation.js" file on a page that contains a Sitefinity MVC form. The code should be placed after the form.

You can even paste it directly in the Chrome DevTools console on a Sitefinity page that has a form to see it in action.

## Version Support...

Tested in Sitefinity versions 10, 11, 12.
