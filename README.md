# SitefinityClientSideFormValidationMVC
Custom form validation for Sitefinity MVC forms using vanilla client side JavaScript.

## Includes...

Validation of all fields and inputs at once, thus removing the need to rely on HTML5 validation of each field individually
Pattern validation for email and number fields etc.
Smooth scrolling to areas that fail validation on form submit
Allows creative control over the way form validtaion is handled

To implement, simply run the code found in the "SF_ClientSideFormValidation.js" file on a page that contains a Sitefinity MVC form. You can even past it in the Chrome DevTools console on such a page to see it in action.
