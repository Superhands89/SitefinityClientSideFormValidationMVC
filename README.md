# SitefinityClientSideFormValidationMVC
Custom form validation for Sitefinity MVC forms using vanilla client side JavaScript (includes pattern validation and smooth scrolling to areas that fail validation on form submit).

This allows you greater creative control over the way form validtaion is handled without relying on HTML5 validation of each field individually.

To implement, simply run the code found in the "SF_ClientSideFormValidation.js" file on a page that contains a Sitefinity MVC form. You can even past it in the Chrome DevTools console on such a page to see it in action.
